## Dataset
This project uses the `penguins.csv` dataset, which contains measurements (bill length, flipper length, body mass, etc.) for three penguin species: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo.

## Script
The script `penguin_analysis.py` loads the dataset, performs two descriptive analyses (summary statistics and species counts), and generates a bar chart.

## Outputs
- `summary_output.csv` — descriptive statistics for numeric columns  
- `species_counts.csv` — count of penguins by species  
- `penguin_species_plot.png` — bar chart image

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Make sure `penguins.csv` is in the main folder.  
3. Run the script with Python 3:  
   ```bash
   python3 penguin_analysis.py
